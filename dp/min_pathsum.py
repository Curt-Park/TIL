"""
64. Minimum Path Sum
Medium

Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Example:

Input:
[
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]

Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1â†’3â†’1â†’1â†’1 minimizes the sum.
