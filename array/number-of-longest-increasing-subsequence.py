673. Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence
Medium

Given an integer array nums, return the number of longest increasing subsequences.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.


Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 2000
-106 <= nums[i] <= 106
