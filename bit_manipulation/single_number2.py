137. Single Number II
Medium

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears 
three times except for one, which appears exactly once. 
Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. 
Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:

Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3

Example 2:

Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
